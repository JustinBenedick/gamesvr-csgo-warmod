## Tournament Flow via [Warmod [BFG]](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=225474)

Server starts in *warm up* mode where players can toggle themselves as "/ready". Once all ten players are ready *knife mode* begins.

Last player standing at the end of *knife mode* gets to decide which side to start on (CT or T) by typing either `/stay` or `/switch`.

Another *warm up* mode begins; once all players are ready "live on three" runs and live play begins.

Half-time starts after 15 rounds and lasts 30 seconds. Players sides are swapped.

At the end scoreboard shows and server freezes.

## Client Checks
The following checks can be preformed from a connected csgo client

#### Verify LL Config is Loaded

Any message generated by Warmod should be prepended with “[LL-Server]” instead of “[Warmod]” in the chat window (press `y` to bring up). An easy way to get Warmod to generate a message would be by using the `/ready` or `/unready` commands.

#### Verify Metamod and SourceMod are Working

Press `y` to open game chat; then type `!sm_admin`. Either the text "you do not have access to this command" should be displayed or a menu should pop up.

#### Verify WarMod [BFG] is Loaded

Press `y` to open game chat and enter `/info`. Warmod should be listed in the output.
